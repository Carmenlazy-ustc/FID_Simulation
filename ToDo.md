Check:
* t_90 <-> current
* flux in coil: B/<B> or B/|B| ? 

ToDo:
* scale flux in coil function to allow for better memory usage
* use filter to get fft
* FFT as function of gradient strength
* dominating white noise
* histogram omega_cell
* mean(B0), --> number of cells?
* linear gradient
* exp(-t/T) gradient
* estimate S/N from exp data
* estimate type of noise from data, use Allen Std. deviation
* check number of cells for simulations sufficient


Reduce Approximations:
* Numerical solution Bloch Equations
* T_1
