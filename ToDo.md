Check:
* t_90 <-> current
* flux in coil: B/<B> or B/|B| ?
* pickup_flux/N_cells

ToDo:
* histogram omega_cell
* mean(B0), --> number of cells?
* check number of cells for simulations sufficient
* FFT as function of gradient strength
* estimate S/N from exp data
* estimate type of noise from data, use Allen Std. deviation

Reduce Approximations:
* Numerical solution Bloch Equations
* T_1
